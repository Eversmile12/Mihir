For more information, please refer to the 'Ordering Transactions' section in the Alchemy Transfers API documentation page.###"}
{"prompt": "Why does an ERC721 transfer have 0 value? \n\n###\n\n", "completion": " ERC721 transfers have a 0 value because the ERC721 standard does not include a 'value' field like the ERC20 standard does. Instead, the transfer is simply a transfer of ownership of the token. For more information, please refer to the 'ERC721 Transfers' section in the Alchemy Transfers API documentation page.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the different types of block tags? \n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In Alchemy's Transfers API, there are three types of block tags: latest, earliest, and pending. These tags can be used to specify the block at which to start the search for transfers. The 'latest' tag searches for transfers in the most recent block, while 'earliest' searches from the first block. 'Pending' searches for transfers in the current block being mined. You can specify the block tag in the 'fromBlock' parameter of the API request. For example, to search for transfers starting from block 100 using the 'earliest' tag, the parameter would be 'fromBlock': '0x64'.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the two different types of Block tags useful in the toBlock field of getAssetTransfers latest? \n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The two different types of Block tags useful in the toBlock field of getAssetTransfers latest are 'indexed' and 'latest'. The 'latest' tag refers to the latest block that was mined on the blockchain you're querying i.e. the current head of the blockchain. On the other hand, the 'indexed' tag returns transfers data from our cache which may not be up-to-date with the latest block mined on chain. This is useful in case of network fork or partial outage and your application can tolerate some lag. For more information, please refer to the 'Block Tags' section in the Alchemy Transfers API Quickstart documentation page.###"}
